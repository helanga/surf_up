- According to above 2 tables, the minimum temperature in month of June is 64F and December 56F .
Keep in mind water temperature is typically about two months behind air temperature. Winter surfing is generally done in water below 50Â°F.
Since minimum temperature in December is 56F, W. Avy  can run his shop even in December.
